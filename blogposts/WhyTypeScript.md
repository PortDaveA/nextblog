## The Pros and Cons of TypeScript

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking, classes, and interfaces. It can be used to improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of JavaScript code. My initial reaction to typescript was that I saw it as an unnecessary complication, one of many in the web development field. However, after some research and
a few tutorial, here is what I found. 

### Pros

* **Type checking:** TypeScript's type checking can help to prevent errors and improve code quality.
* **Classes and interfaces:** TypeScript's classes and interfaces can help to improve code readability and maintainability.
* **Modules:** TypeScript's modules can help to improve code organization and readability.
* **Code inference:** TypeScript's code inference can help to make code more concise.
* **IDE support:** Most modern IDEs have good TypeScript support, which can make it easier to write and debug TypeScript code.

### Cons

* **Compile time:** TypeScript code needs to be compiled before it can be run, which can add an extra step to the development process.
* **Learning curve:** TypeScript has a steeper learning curve than JavaScript.
* **Not always necessary:** TypeScript is not always necessary for small projects or projects where type checking is not a major concern.

Overall, TypeScript is a powerful language that can be used to improve the quality, readability, and maintainability of JavaScript code. However, it is important to weigh the pros and cons of TypeScript before deciding whether or not to use it for a particular project. I personally stand corrected. You win Paul!
